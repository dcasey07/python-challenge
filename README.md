# Python Challenge: Module 3

## Objective
The code used in this challenge dynamically references the data in their respective datasets to produce formatted files that can be used for data analysis and more practical purposes. It was coded in such a way to allow for future (and potentially revised or updated) datasets that follow the same conventions in their csvs to automatically produce calculations and format the information in a more palatable way.

## Attributions

In order to pull the highest value from the dictionary in the election results, I used the max() function that utilizes key= to reference the dictionary the data was pulled from. I pulled this concept from the following resource:

## Notes
I was pushing to the master branch of this repository the entire time, so I switched the default branch from main to master.
